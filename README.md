Data Exploration
Start by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and the range of values for each feature.

Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: Address any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in the dataset.
Categorical Variable Conversion: Convert categorical variables (e.g., model, color) into a numerical format suitable for analysis (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Feature Extraction
Identifying Relevant Features: Performed feature extraction to identify key features that strongly affect mobile phone prices.
Feature Selection Techniques: Use statistical methods, visualizations, or feature importance techniques (e.g., correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction) to narrow down the list of important features.

Model Building
Dataset Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Developing a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) for price prediction.

Model Evaluation
Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean squared error) to assess its accuracy in predicting mobile phone prices.

Feature Importance Analysis
Analysing feature importances obtained from the model to confirm the significance of the identified features during the extraction phase.

Report and Visualization
Preparing a comprehensive report summarizing the project's findings. Include visualizations and insights related to feature importance and their impact on price prediction.
